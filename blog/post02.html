<h1>Blog Post 2</h1>
<h2>Writer's Block</h2>
<p>So today I just decided to make this blog post to talk about writer's block and why it takes so long to write fiction... I used to be able to write story after story but now I just get stuck, not knowing what to write...
<br><br>
Sometimes I just want to fall asleep and never wake up...
<br><br>
Other times I feel like I can do anything, but those days are rare... All I know is my next fiction will be about who goes by "X" and for those of you that don't like a love story every now and then, well I'm fucking sorry! xD
<br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks for reading and I'm gonna get over this writer's block soon, I promise!</p>
