<h1>Blog Post 4</h1>
<h2>Back on the DW</h2>
<p>Hey, it's me and I'm back
<br><br>
It's been good to see everyone again. :) Don't worry, I'll get around to writing more fan fiction eventually. :3 I've updated pretty much everything I can think of but please let me know if I missed something. And no, don't say xD I'm also gonna try to make these blogs a bit longer, but sometimes I just don't know what to say. :/ Talking to someone is a lot different.
<br><br>
One thing is for sure: I've met some amazing people on here that I would call my friends. Despite all the bad stuff here, there's a lot of benefits of freedom and privacy (assuming it still exists). People can really be themselves and aren't held back by societal restrictions.
<br><br>
I hope to make many more friendships here, and just have fun. Thanks for stopping by, ;)
