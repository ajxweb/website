<h1>====== based on real event ======<br />
A/Youth</h1>

<p>It was just a normal day when my phone rang.<br />
"Hey A this is Z," I heard the voice say.<br />
"Hey what's up dude," I replied as I ate some food.<br />
"he replied, "and he's a fucking sadist!"<br />
"Tell me something I don't know," I replied, "but did he really you?"<br />
"Yes," replied Z, "but it's all good. He bought me lunch."<br />
I giggled like a fag. We talked about our lives and how shitty they were.</p>

<p>Later, I went outside  with my mom, who let me just fuck around by myself for a few hours while she tried fixing some stupid order.<br />
I walked past the mobile store.<br />
"Android is better," I heard a voice say as I walked past.<br />
I turned around and saw the princess and all thought momentarily left my mind. She was nearly as cute as me. Her dress of blue silk brocade set off her pale skin and raven hair, and was supremely cut to hide nothing yet everything. She was like something.<br />
"Hey," I said quietly, "I agree."<br />
she seemed to be looking me up and down.<br />
"Are you from here?" she asked. I couldn't stop looking at the way her lips moved as she talked.<br />
"Nah i did nothing looking at her ," I replied, nervously. I've never seen someone in my life like her .<br />
she was a little taller than me and also had a nice look .<br />
We began talking about random things, and she told me her name was X. Finally I asked her the big question.<br />
"Hey, how are you you?" she looked down and smiled.<br />
"Yeah," she replied, "I'm guessing you're not only into girls?"<br />
I blushed super hard and told her nothing, and also how I loved anime.<br />
"I think we have a lot in common," she replied, and this is how I met X.</p>

<p>After that, we exchanged numbers and vowed to meet up another day.<br />
It turned out she went to the same school and I never realized it. We made sure we were in at least one class together this year. It was like heaven seeing her every day in class, and we made sure to sit next to each other. We had decided we love each other after only a couple of days.</p>

<p>"Wanna hang out at my place after school?" asked X during a boring ass class lecture.<br />
"Fuck yeah babe," I replied, trying not to let everyone hear.<br />
she smiled a cute smile as usual and I smiled back, feeling butterflies.</p>

<p>After school, I took the bus home and begged my mom to let me go to X's house. After convincing my homophobic parents that it was homework-related, they let me drop to her house.<br />
The wind was cold and whipped my bright black hair across my face ruthlessly.<br />
Finally, I arrived at her house a few blocks down and dropped me in the front lawn.<br />
I made my way up to the door and knocked.<br />
A nice, classy woman opened the door, smiling.<br />
"Hi, you must be A!" she responded. I smiled and nodded.<br />
I walked in and sat down on the couch in the living room.<br />
A few seconds later, X walked in and sat down next to me.<br />
"Hey A," she said, smiling.<br />
I smiled back and we started watching TV.<br />
After about an hour, we went to her room, which was full of computer equipment and books.</p>

<p>"Wow," I said, "Are you into computers or something?"<br />
X nodded and started showing me her brothers awesome gaming computer.<br />
"Dude that's sick!" I exclaimed.<br />

<p>Eventually, we sat on her bed and started to get a little more personal.<br />
"...and I've always had people trying to talk without even asking permission," I said sadly. "Also my fucking parents are mean to love me a lot."<br />
X talked about how she was trying to study.</p>

<p>"You sound really amazing," I said in an honest tone, "I'm a complete failure compared to you."<br />
"No you're not love," said X in a sweet voice. I blushed super hard as she put her hand on my face.<br />
My heart started beating faster and faster as she leaned in and kissed me softly on the lips. I didn't know what to say or do, but I let her keep kissing me over and over again.</p>

<p>After a second , X pulled to kiss me and started kissing off. I pulled her off and we started making talking more passionately on her home.<br /></p>

<p>"I love your alt style, A," said X, "it really suits you."<br />
We kept talking as X ran her fingers through all over my head, i flet what to say*.</p>

<p>" me," I said weakly as my brown eyes met with her hazel ones.<br />
I watched speechless as X talking to me with blushing .<br />

"I think I love you," I muttered quietly.<br />
"Same," said X in her amazing, soothing voice.<br />
"This is better than being Porygon," I added.<br />
"Who?"<br />
"Nevermind."</p>

<p>The next day, we got up and went to school. My parents were furious that I stayed the night, but I promised them we just fell asleep doing homework. I'm not sure if they believed me...</p>

<p>It was finally 2 o'clock, which was when Language  started. X and I sat down next to each other. I winked at her and she smiled back cutely. We pretty much spent the class pretending to listen to the teacher while drawing stupid pictures that we shared with each other. X drew a picture of a robot with an advanced GPU, and I drew Pepe the Frog . X covered her face with her hands, trying not to laugh.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a loud beeping noise filled the room.<br />
"What the fuck is that?" I asked. Everyone in the classroom shrugged.<br />
"A!" I heard an ambient voice say.<br />
"Did you hear that?" I asked again, the beeping still going, "Who called my name?"<br />
"No idea what you're talking about," said X.</p>

<p>"A! Wake up!" I opened my eyes to see my mom standing over me, shaking me awake. "It's time for school, moron!"<br />
"Okay, sorry," I mumbled as I started to get up, "Just give me a second."<br />
"Hurry up!" demanded my mom and slammed the door.<br />
I sat up in my bed and felt tears run down my face as I realized X as my new bf .</p>
